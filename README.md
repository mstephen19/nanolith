## About

What's ‚ú®**Nanolith**‚ú®? Nanolith is a performant, reliable, and super simple-to-use multi-threading library with great documentation and seamless TypeScript support. It serves to entirely replace the _(now deprecated)_ [Threadz](https://github.com/mstephen19/threadz) library.

Nanolith was designed with simplicity and performance in mind - it has just two main APIs. The **Nanolith API** can be used to call one-off [task workers](#running-a-task), and directly on that API, the [`launchService()`](#launching-a-service) function can be called to launch a long-running **Service** worker which has access to your task function [definitions](#defining-a-set-of-tasks) and will only finish once it's been told to `close()`. When you launch a service, you are immediately able to [communicate](#messaging-between-the-main-thread-and-a-service) back and forth between the worker and the main thread.

Enough talk though, let's look at how this thing works.

## Installation

The latest version can be installed via any package manager of your choice.

```shell
npm install nanolith@latest
```

```shell
yarn add nanolith@latest
```

Beta versions are released under the "next" tag, and can be installed like this:

```shell
npm install nanolith@next
```

```shell
yarn add nanolith@next
```

## What's new?

The newest stable version of Nanolith is `0.2.3` ‚ú®

### Features üÜï

* `waitForMessage()` method on [`Messenger`](#using-messenger) and [`Service`](#using-a-service)
* _Streaming_ data between threads! See examples [here](#streaming-data-between-threads)

### Fixes & improvements üõ†Ô∏è

* `parent.waitForMessenger()` not working when registered in an `__initializeService()` hook call.

## Defining a set of tasks

No matter what your use-case of Nanolith is, you will always start with the `define()` function. This function takes an object containing (sync or async) task definitions, and returns an object representing the **Nanolith API**, which can be used to access Nanolith's main functionalities.

To get started, **create a separate file dedicated to task definitions** and export a variable pointing to the awaited value of the `define()` function containing your definitions üóíÔ∏è It is **absolutely key** to ensure that you don't have any other function calls within this file.

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { define } from 'nanolith';

const subtract = (x: number, y: number) => x - y;

// Exporting the variable is not a requirement, but is necessary in order to
// have access to the API later on.
export const api = await define({
    add(x: number, y: number) {
        return x + y;
    },
    async waitThenAdd(x: number, y: number) {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5e3))
        return x + y;
    },
    // Functions don't have to be directly defined within the object parameter,
    // they can be defined elsewhere outside of "define", or even imported from
    // a different file.
    subtract,
});
```

The `add()`, `waitThenAdd()`, and `subtract()` functions are now ready to be run on a separate thread.

> **Important:** In these docs, we'll be using the word "task" a lot. A "task" can be defined as any function that has been provided to the `define()` function and is ready to be called and run on a separate thread.

### Creating multiple sets of definitions in the same file with `identifier`s

Because Nanolith runs workers directly within the same file you created your task definitions, it will generate a unique `identifier` for each set of definitions. This identifier is quite basic, and is only based on the names of the functions you passed in.

_In cases where this is not enough_, you need to provide any second or third sets of definitions which are created in the same file with a **constant** and **unique** `identifier` so Nanolith knows which code to run within the worker ‚úèÔ∏è This information can be provided in the options parameter of the `define()` function.

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { define } from 'nanolith';

const subtract = (x: number, y: number) => x - y;

// The identifier for this set of definitions will be automatically
// generated by Nanolith
export const api = await define({
    something(x: number, y: number) {
        return x + y;
    },
    async foo(x: number, y: number) {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5e3))
        return x + y;
    },
    subtract,
});

// The automatically generated identifier will not help us here,
// because this set of definitions contains functions of the same
// names and in the same exact order. Therefore, we need to manually
// set our own unique identifier.
export const logger = await define({
    something: () => console.log('hello'),
    async foo() {
        return 'foo';
    }
    // The identifier for this set will be "logger"
}, { identifier: 'logger' });
```

Please note that when manually assigning an identifier, it **must always stay the same**. You cannot, for example, do something like this:

```TypeScript
// WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!
import { define } from 'nanolith';
import { v4 } from 'uuid';

export const logger = await define({
    sayHello: () => console.log('hello'),
    // The below code is wrong
    // and will result in errors!
}, { identifier: v4() });
// WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!
```

These identifiers are only used internally by Nanolith, so they can be absolutely anything; however, you might want to make your identifiers recognizable purely for documentation purposes (ex. "image_processing", "general_utils", "data_parsing").

### Hooks

You may run into situations where you want to run a certain piece of logic before/after each task is called, or before a service is launched. There are five hooks which are available for use when creating a set of definitions that provide this functionality ü™ù

These hooks have specific names, and are functions that take one parameter (the worker's `threadID`) and return nothing.

| Name | Functionality |
|-|-|
| `__initializeService()` | A function which will be automatically called once when a service for the set of definitions is launched. If asynchronous, it will be awaited. Note that the `launchService()` function's promise resolves only after this function has completed. |
| `__beforeTask()` | A function which will be automatically called before each task function is run. Not supported with services. |
| `__afterTask()` | A function which will be automatically called after each task function is run. Not supported with services. |
| `__beforeServiceTask()` | A function which will automatically called before a task is run within a service. |
| `__afterServiceTask()` | A function which will automatically called after a task is run within a service. |

### Dealing with "Cannot find module" with the `file` option

Though it shouldn't happen, in some strange cases there is a chance that an error like this will occur when the Nanolith `pool` instance tries to spawn a worker üí©:

```text
Error: Cannot find module '/some/path/to/some/file.js'
```

If this occurs, it means that Nanolith failed to correctly determine the location of the file in which you called `define()`. Correct this error by providing the proper path under the `file` option.

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { define } from 'nanolith';

const subtract = (x: number, y: number) => x - y;

export const api = await define({
    add(x: number, y: number) {
        return x + y;
    },
    async waitThenAdd(x: number, y: number) {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5e3))
        return x + y;
    },
    subtract,
}, { file: '/correct/path/to/some/file.js' });
```

## Running a task

Tasks are one-off workers that are spawned, run the specified task function, then are immediately terminated automatically. The return value of the task function is available back on the main thread when using the Nanolith API.

> **Note:** All tasks are async, regardless of whether or not the defined task function is async. This is because, behind the scenes, the task runner must wait for its turn in the [`pool`](#using-pool)'s queue, then for the `Worker` to be created, and finally for your task function to finish executing before returning its value back to you on the main thread.

Considering the task definitions from the section above, this is how the `add()` task would be called to be run on a separate thread.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { api } from './worker.js';

// This spawns a new task worker, runs the "add" function, sends the
// return value back to the main thread, then terminates the worker.
const sum = await api({
    name: 'add',
    params: [4, 5],
})

// This also spawns a new worker and runs the same workflow as
// described above
const sum2 = await api({
    name: 'add',
    params: [10, 6],
})

console.log(sum) // -> 9
console.log(sum2) // -> 16
```

That's it! Simply call the **Nanolith API** directly providing the name of the task along with the parameters (if any) to pass to the task function, and the function will be run on a separate thread. Any errors thrown by the function can be safely handled by using a [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) block.

> **Important**: Tasks (and [services](#launching-a-service)) cannot by default be called/launched from within the same file as where their tasks were `define`d. When this is attempted, an error will be thrown. To disable this behavior, set the `safeMode` option in the `define()` function to `false` _(not recommended)_.

### Configuring a task

When running a task, there are more configurations available other than the `name` and `params` of the task function.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `name` | string | - | The name of the task function to run. |
| `params` | array | `[]` | The parameters to pass to the task function. |
| `priority` | boolean | `false` | Whether or not to push the worker to the front of the [`pool`](#using-pool)'s queue and treat it as a priority worker. |
| `reffed` | boolean | `true` | When `true`, [`worker.ref()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#workerref) will be called. When `false`, [`worker.unref()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#workerunref) will be called. |
| `options` | [WorkerOptions](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options) | `{}` | An object containing _most_ of the options available on the [`Worker`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options) constructor. |
| `messengers` | Messenger[] | `[]` | An array of [`Messenger`](#using-messenger) objects to expose to the task's worker. |

### Using the before and after task hooks

When calling tasks, you might want to run the same piece of logic before or after each task (or both). Luckily, rather than copying and pasting the same logic into each task function in your set of definitions, you can use the `__beforeTask` and `afterTask` [hooks](#hooks) on your set of definitions.

## Launching a service

Services differ from tasks, as they are not one-off workers. They are long-running workers that will continue running until they are `close()`d. A service has access to all of the task functions in the set of definitions it is using üé©

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { api } from './worker.js';

// Spawns a service worker and waits for it to go
// "online" before resolving
const service = await api.launchService({
    // Provide an exception handler to know when an uncaught exception
    // is thrown by the underlying worker, and handle it as needed.
    // If this is not provided, uncaught exceptions will go unseen.
    exceptionHandler: ({ error }) => {
        console.error('oops!', error.message);
    }
});

// Runs the "add" function in the worker created by the
// "launchService" function
const sum = await service.call({
    name: 'add',
    params: [4, 5],
})

// Also runs the "add" function in the worker created by
// the "launchService" function
const sum2 = await service.call({
    name: 'add',
    params: [10, 6],
})

console.log(sum) // -> 9
console.log(sum2) // -> 16

// Terminates the worker
await service.close();
```

### Configuring a service

Similar to running a task, various options are available when configuring a service. The `launchService()` function accepts all of the following options.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `exceptionHandler` | Function | - | An optional but recommended option that allows for the catching of uncaught exceptions within the service. |
| `priority` | boolean | `false` | Whether or not to push the worker to the front of the [`pool`](#using-pool)'s queue and treat it as a priority worker. |
| `reffed` | boolean | `true` | When `true`, [`worker.ref()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#workerref) will be called. When `false`, [`worker.unref()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#workerunref) will be called. |
| `options` | [WorkerOptions](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options) | `{}` | An object containing _most_ of the options available on the [`Worker`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options) constructor. |
| `messengers` | Messenger[] | `[]` | An array of [`Messenger`](#using-messenger) objects to expose to the service worker. |

### Using the service initializer hook

There may be times when you want to have a task function be automatically called right when the service goes online. This is called a **service initializer** [hook](#hooks), and it can be used to register listeners on the `parent` or on a `Messenger` instance, or to do any other internal configuration of the service before any tasks can be called on it.

To create a service initializer function, simply name one of your task definitions `__initializeService` and define your initialization logic there. The function will be run immediately after the service goes online, and the `launchService()` function will only resolve after the initialization function has completed its work.

### Using a service

The main method on launched services that you'll be using is `.call()`; however, there are many more properties and methods available.

| Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `threadID` | Property | The thread ID of the underlying [`Worker`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options) for the `Service` instance. |
| `closed` | Property | Whether or not the underlying `Worker` has exited its process. This will be `true` after calling `await service.close()`|
| `activeCalls` | Property | The number of currently active calls on the service. |
| `worker` | Property | Returns the raw underlying `Worker` instance being used by the service.. |
| `call()` | Method | Call a task to be run within the service worker. |
| `close()` | Method | Terminates the worker, ending its process and marking the `Service` instance as `closed`. |
| `sendMessage()` | Method | Send a message to the service worker. |
| `onMessage()` | Method | Receive messages from the service worker. |
| `offMessage()` | Method | Remove a callback function added with `onMessage()`. |
| `waitForMessage()` | Method | Wait for specific messages coming from the service worker. |
| [`sendMessenger()`](#dynamically-sending-messengers-to-services) | Method | Dynamically send a [`Messenger`](#using-messenger) object to the service worker. |
| [`onStream()`](#streaming-data-between-threads) | Method | Receive data streams from the service worker. |
| [`createStream()`](#streaming-data-between-threads) | Method | Create a `Writable` instance that can be piped into in order to stream data to the service worker. The service worker can listen for incoming streams with the `parent.onStream()` listener. |

## Managing concurrency

To keep things safe and efficient, Nanolith automatically manages the creation of task and service workers with a single instance of the internal `Pool` class. The `pool` has a queue with a maximum size, and is enqueued into any time you [run a task](#running-a-task) or [launch a service](#launching-a-service). It has been implemented to prevent too many workers from running at once. This basically means that if, for example, the pool's concurrency is configured to 12 and you are running 12 services but then try to launch another one, that service will wait for one of the already running services to shut down before launching.

> **Tip:** By default, workers are added to the back of the queue; however, it is possible to mark a worker "cut in line" by marking it as `priority` in the options [for calling a task](#configuring-a-task) or [for launching a service](#configuring-a-service).

The concurrency of the `pool` is by default equal to _the number of cores on the machine currently running the process_; however, it can be changed by using the `.setConcurrency()` method and `ConcurrencyOption`.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { pool, ConcurrencyOption } from 'nanolith';

// One thread per four cores.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.Quarter);
// One thread per two cores.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.Half);
// Default concurrency. One thread per core (x1).
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.Default);
// One thread per core.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.x1);
// Two threads per core.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.x2);
// Four threads per core.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.x4);
// Six threads per core.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.x6);
// Eight threads per core.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.x8);
// Ten threads per core.
pool.setConcurrency(ConcurrencyOption.x10);
```

The recommended values are `x1` or `x2`; however, the other options are there if a higher concurrency is necessary.

### Using `pool`

The global `pool` instance has various properties and methods that can be accessed.

| Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `option` | Property | A direct reference to the `ConcurrencyOption` enum. |
| `maxConcurrency` | Property | The currency maximum concurrency of the pool. Can be changed with `setConcurrency()` |
| `maxed` | Property | Whether or not the pool has reached its max concurrency. |
| `queueLength` | Property | The current number of item in the pool's queue. |
| `activeCount` | Property | The current number of workers that are running under the pool. |
| `idle` | Property | A boolean defining whether or not the pool is currently doing nothing. |
| `next` | Property | Returns the internal `PoolItemOptions` for the next worker in the queue to be run. |
| `setConcurrency()` | Method | Modify the concurrency of the pool. Use this wisely. |

## Creating a service cluster

When you have multiple services using the same set of task definitions, it is difficult to manually allocate tasks to each of them. For example, if you have 3 services running that all have access to the `formatVideo()` function, you would ideally like to run the next call for `formatVideo()` on the service that is currently the least busy.

Rather than you needing to do any guesswork or complex message passing between services to determine which one is the least busy, the `ServiceCluster` API is low-cost option that can do all of this for you.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { ServiceCluster } from 'nanolith';
import { api } from './worker.js';

const cluster = new ServiceCluster(api);

// Launch three services that will be managed by the cluster
await cluster.launch(3, {
    // All three services will be launched using these options
    exceptionHandler: (error) => {
        console.error(error);
    },
});

// The ".use()" method returns the least busy service out of all
// the services.
const promise1 = cluster.use().call({
    name: 'waitThenAdd',
    params: [4, 3]
})

// This call will run on a different service from the first one,
// because the first one has one active call, while the others
// have zero.
const promise2 = cluster.use().call({
    name: 'waitThenAdd',
    params: [4, 5]
})

const [sum1, sum2] = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);

console.log(sum1) // -> 7
console.log(sum2) // -> 9

// Close all services attached to the cluster.
await cluster.closeAll();
```

### Using `ServiceCluster`

Each `ServiceCluster` instance has access to a few methods and properties.

| Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `activeServices` | Property | The number of currently running services on the cluster. |
| `activeServiceCalls` | Property | The number of currently active task calls on all services on the cluster. |
| `currentServices` | Property | An array of objects for each active service on the cluster. Each object contains the `service`, its current `active` count, and its unique `identifier`. |
| `launchService()` | Method **Deprecated** | Launch a new service on the provided **Nanolith API** and automatically manage it with the `ServiceCluster`. |
| `launch()` | Method | Launch a number of new services on the provided **Nanolith API** and automatically manage them with the `ServiceCluster` instance. Accepts a number and `service.launchService()` options as its arguments. |
| `addService()` | Method | Add an already running service to to the cluster. |
| `use()` | Method | Returns the `Service` instance on the cluster that is currently the least active. If no services are active on the cluster, an error will be thrown. |
| `closeAll()` | Method | Runs the `close()` method on all `Service` instances on the cluster. |
| `closeAllIdle()` | Method | Runs the `close()` method on all `Service` instances on the cluster which are currently not running any tasks. |

## Communicating between threads

In **Nanolith** there are two ways to communicate with workers.

### Messaging between the main thread and a service

On the [`Service`](#using-a-service) object, there are many methods present which allow for sending and receiving messages to the service worker. These methods are `service.sendMessage()`, `service.onMessage()`, and `service.offMessage()`.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { api } from './worker.js';

const service = await api.launchService();

// Send a message to the service worker
service.sendMessage('hi');

// Handle messages received from the service worker
service.onMessage<string>(function callback(data) {
    console.log(`received message from worker: ${data}`);
    // Once the message has been received, remove the listener
    service.offMessage(callback);
});

await service.close();
```

That covers it on the main thread.

Within workers, the global `parent` object can be used to send and receive messages to a `Service` instance back on the main thread. `parent` has the same exact functionalities, along with the additional `parent.waitForMessage()`.

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { define, parent } from 'nanolith';

export const api = await define({
    __initializeService() {
        // Handle messages received from the main thread
        parent.onMessage<number>(function callback(data) {
            console.log(data - 351);
            // Once the message has been received, remove the listener
            parent.offMessage(callback);
        });
    },
    async sendSomething() {
        // Wait for a message to be received from the main thread. Once
        // the condition returns with "true", the promise resolves with
        // the received data.
        await parent.waitForMessage<number>((data) => data === 1337);
        // Send a message to the main thread
        parent.sendMessage(420);
    },
});
```

> When using services, it is recommended to register listeners on `parent` within the [`__initializeService()` hook](#using-the-service-initializer-hook) to avoid the need to manually call a custom task which registers listeners.

### Sending & receiving messages between tasks/services and the main thread

More complex use cases may demand that communication can happen not only between the main thread and services, but between all threads.

> If your use case does not demand the need to communicate to multiple workers from the same thread, or to communicate between/amongst workers, you do not need to use the `Messenger` API.

The `Messenger` class fills the gap for this use case by utilizing an underlying [`BroadcastChannel`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-broadcastchannelname). A messenger can be created by calling the `Messenger` constructor and providing a unique but reproducible name.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { Messenger } from 'nanolith';

const messenger = new Messenger('foo-bar');
```

After the messenger has been created, it can be passed into a task worker or service worker within their initialization options.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { Messenger } from 'nanolith';
import { api } from './worker.js';

const messenger = new Messenger('foo-bar');

// Attaching a messenger to a service worker
const service = await api.launchService({
    messengers: [messenger],
});

// Attaching a messenger to a task worker
await api({
    name: 'foo',
    messengers: [messenger],
});

await service.close();
```

> You can attach as many messengers as you want to workers; however, ensure that they all have different names to avoid issues!

Similar to [`parent`](#sending--receiving-messages-between-tasksservices-and-the-main-thread), there is a specialized global object for using messengers within workers called `messengers`. It has only two functions, `messengers.seek()` and `messengers.use()`.

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { define, messengers } from 'nanolith';

export const api = await define({
    async sendSomething() {
        // We now have access to the Messenger object we
        // created and attached to the worker through this
        // variable. It can be used to send and receive
        // messages on the underlying BroadcastChannel.
        const messenger = await messengers.use('foo-bar');

        // View all messengers currently attached to the
        // worker as an object.
        console.log(messengers.seek());
    },
});
```

### Using `Messenger`

Each `Messenger` instance has access to a various methods and properties.

| Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `ID` | Property | The unique identifier that is shared across all messenger instances using the two ports originally created when instantiating the first `Messenger`. |
| `uniqueKey` | Property | Each `Messenger` instance is assigned a unique key that allows it to internally ignore messages on the `BroadcastChannel` which were sent by itself. |
| `onMessage()` | Method | Listen for messages coming to the `Messenger`. |
| `waitForMessage()` | Method | Wait for a specific message on the `Messenger`. |
| `offMessage()` | Method | Remove a function from the list of callbacks to be run when a message is received on the `Messenger`. |
| `sendMessage()` | Method | Send a messenger to be received by any other `Messenger` instances with the same identifier. |
| `transfer()` | Method | Turns the `Messenger` instance into an object that can be sent to and from workers. |
| `setRef()` | Method | By default, the `BroadcastChannel` is unreffed. Call this function to change that. When `true`, [`ref()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#broadcastchannelref) will be called. When `false`, [`unref()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#broadcastchannelunref) will be called. |
| `close()` | Method | Closes the underlying `BroadcastChannel` connection that is being used. Does not close all `BroadcastChannel`s on all Messenger objects |
| `closeAll()` | Method | Closes **all** underlying `BroadcastChannel` connections on all `Messenger` objects that are currently active for the corresponding identifier. |

### Dynamically sending messengers to services

If you didn't provide your `Messenger` instance in the `messengers` array option when launching your service (as seen in the example [here](#sending--receiving-messages-between-tasksservices-and-the-main-thread)), you can still attach them dynamically with the `service.sendMessenger()` method.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { Messenger } from 'nanolith';
import { api } from './worker.js';

const service = await api.launchService();

// Creating the messenger after launching the service
const messenger = new Messenger('hello');

// The promise resolves once the service worker has
// notified the Messenger instance that it has
// successfully received the messenger.
await service.sendMessenger(messenger);

messenger.sendMessage('hello from main thread!');

await service.close();
```

### Streaming data between threads

Sending data between services and the main thread using methods like [`service.sendMessage()`](#using-a-service) or [`parent.sendMessage()`](#messaging-between-the-main-thread-and-a-service) is efficient and intuitive; however, there may be cases where you need to send much larger pieces of data to a service, or from a service to the main thread. In Node.js, we usually use the [`Readable` and `Writable` APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) to do this in chunks.

> **Note:** Cross-thread data streaming is currently only supported between service workers and the main thread. It is not yet available on the `Messenger` API.

Both the `parent` object and all [`Service`](#using-a-service) instances have access to the `createStream()` and `onStream()` functions, which intuitively do exactly what they describe.

When handling incoming streams from the main thread, this logic can be placed within the [`__initializeService` hook](#hooks):

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { define, parent } from 'nanolith';

export const api = await define({
    __initializeService() {
        parent.onStream((stream) => {
            // Only handle streams where an object with a name
            // of "foo" has been attached to it.
            if (stream.metaData.name !== 'foo') return;

            stream.on('data', (data) => {
                console.log('received in worker', data);
            });
        });
    },
});
```

On the main thread, we simply need to create a stream to the service worker with the `createStream()` method, then pipe our stream into it.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { Readable } from 'stream';
import { api } from './worker.js';

const data = ['hello', 'world', 'foo', 'bar'];

const myStream = new Readable({
    read() {
        if (!data.length) return this.push(null);

        this.push(data.splice(0, 1)[0]);
    },
});

const service = await api.launchService();

// Simply pipe right into the stream resolved by ".createStream()"
myStream.pipe(await service.createStream({ name: 'foo' }));
```

The console output of the code above looks like this:

```text
received in worker <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f>
received in worker <Buffer 77 6f 72 6c 64>
received in worker <Buffer 66 6f 6f>
received in worker <Buffer 62 61 72>
```

Streams can be send over the main thread from a service by simply reversing the roles:

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { Readable } from 'stream';
import { define, parent } from 'nanolith';

export const api = await define({
    async sendStream() {
        const data = ['hello', 'world', 'foo', 'bar'];

        const myStream = new Readable({
            read() {
                if (!data.length) return this.push(null);

                this.push(data.splice(0, 1)[0]);
            },
        });

        // Simply pipe right into the stream resolved by ".createStream()"
        myStream.pipe(await parent.createStream({ name: 'foo' }));
    },
});
```

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { api } from './worker.js';

const service = await api.launchService();

service.onStream((stream) => {
    // Only handle streams where an object with a name
    // of "foo" has been attached to it.
    if (stream.metaData.name !== 'foo') return;

    stream.on('data', (data) => {
        console.log('received on main thread', data);
    });
});

// Call the task that creates and starts the stream
await service.call({ name: 'sendStream' });
```

The output of this code is almost exactly the same as the previous example; however, the logs occur on the main thread rather than within the service worker thread.

> **Important:** The `.onStream()` listener must be registered before the stream is received by the sender. Otherwise, the event will be received. That means that it must be called within `__initializeService()`, or in a task that occurs prior to the stream being sent.

## Examples

Here are a few fun examples where Nanolith is used.

### "Promisify-ing" a for-loop

Classic example. Let's "promisify" a for-loop with **Nanolith**!

```TypeScript
// worker.ts üíº
import { define } from 'nanolith';

export const worker = await define({
    // Note that these "task functions" can be either async or sync - doesn't matter.
    bigForLoop: (msg: string) => {
        for (const _ of Array(900000000).keys()) {
        }
        return msg;
    },
});
```

Notice that there's no bloat. Just keys and values (the "task functions").

In our index file (or wherever else), we can simply import the `worker` variable and call it. This `worker` variable is our **Nanolith** API.

```TypeScript
// index.ts üí°
import { worker } from './worker.js';

// This will spin up a worker and run our bigForLoop function
// inside of it. Once the function returns, the promise will
// resolve with the return value and the worker's process will
// be exited.
const promise = worker({
    name: 'bigForLoop',
    params: ['test'],
});

console.log('hello world');

const result = await promise;

console.log(result);
```

The result of this code, despite the large loop being called prior to the logging of "hello world", outputs this:

```text
hello world
test
```
