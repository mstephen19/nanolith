## About

### So what can you do with it?

Here's a quick rundown of everything you can do in Nanolith:

- Offload heavy tasks to separate threads.
- Run separate-threaded nanoservices that can run any tasks you want.
- Communicate back and forth between threads by sending messages.
- Stream data between threads with the familiar [`node:stream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) API.
