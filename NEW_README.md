## ❔ About

✨**Nanolith**✨ is a performant, reliable, easy-to-use, and well-documented multithreading library. It serves to not only build upon, but entirely replace the _(deprecated)_ [Threadz](https://github.com/mstephen19/threadz) library.

There have always been three main goals for Nanolith:

1. Performance 🏃
2. Ease-of-use 😇
3. Seamless TypeScript support 😎

### So what can you do with it?

Here's a quick rundown of everything you can do in Nanolith:

- Offload expensive tasks to separate threads.
- Spawn up separate-threaded "nanoservices" that can run any tasks you want.
- Communicate back and forth between threads by sending messages.
- Stream data between threads with the already familiar [`node:stream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) API.
- Share memory between threads using the familiar-feeling `SharedMap` class.

## 💾 Installation

The latest version can be installed via any package manager of your choice.

```shell
npm install nanolith@latest
# or
yarn add nanolith@latest
```

Beta versions are released under the **next** tag and can be installed like this:

```shell
npm install nanolith@next
# or
yarn add nanolith@next
```

## 📝 Defining your tasks

A **task** is any function that **you** define which is accessible by Nanolith's APIs. Tasks can be defined using the `define()` function in a separate file dedicated to definitions.

```TypeScript
// worker.ts 💼
import { define } from 'nanolith';

// Exporting the variable is not a requirement, but it is
// necessary to somehow export the resolved value of the
// function in order to have access to it later on.
export const worker = await define({
    add(x: number, y: number) {
        return x + y;
    },
    async waitThenAdd(x: number, y: number) {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5e3))
        return x + y;
    },
    // Functions don't have to be directly defined within the
    // object, they can be defined elsewhere outside, or even
    // imported from a totally different module.
    subtract,
});

function subtract(x: number, y: number) {
    return x - y;
};
```

By passing functions into `define()`, you immediately turn them into multithreadable **tasks**. No further configuration is required.

### `define()` options

As seen above, the first argument to `define()` is an object containing your functions. The second parameter is an object accepting the following _(optional)_ configurations:

| Name | Type | About |
|-|-|-|
| `file` | **string** | If `define()`'s file location detection is not working correctly, the true file location for the set of definitions can be provided here. |
| `identifier` | **string** | A unique identifier for the set of definitions. Overrides the auto-identifier generated by Nanolith. |
| `safeMode` | **boolean** | Whether or not to prevent the usage of the returned **Nanolith** API from within the same file where their definitions were created. Defaults to `true`. |

## 👷 Running a task

After [defining](#📝-defining-your-tasks) a set of tasks, you can import them and call them anywhere by directly using the **Nanolith** API resolved by the `define()` function. The only difference is that instead of being called on the main thread, a new thread will be created for the task and it will be run there.

```TypeScript
// 💡 index.ts
// Importing the Nanolith API we created in worker.ts
import { worker } from './worker.js';

// Run the "add" function on a separate thread and wait
// for it to complete before moving forward.
const result = await worker({
    // Provide the name of the task.
    name: 'add',
    // Provide the parameters of the function.
    params: [2, 3],
});

// The result is sent back to the main thread
// and resolved by the task function call.
console.log(result); // -> 5
```

The new thread's process is shut down after the task finishes.

> **📝 Note:** Notice that even with the synchronous `add()` function, it is now asynchronous when being multithreaded.

### Task function options

`name` and `params` are amongst many of the possible options that can be passed in when running a task:

| Name | Type | About |
|-|-|-|
| `name` | **string** | The name of the task to call. Must be present on the set of definitions. |
| `params` | **any[]** | The arguments for the task in array form. |
| `priority` | **boolean** | Whether or not to treat the task's worker as priority over others when being queued into the `pool`. |
| `reffed` | **boolean** | When `true`, the underlying `Worker` instance is [reffed](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#workerref). Defaults to `false`. |
| `messengers` | [**Messenger**](#📨-communicating-between-threads)**[]** | The `Messenger`s that should be accessible to the task. |
| `options` | **object** | An object containing _most_ of the options available on the [`Worker` constructor](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options). |

## 🎩 Understanding services

**Services** are Nanolith's flagship feature. Running a task on a service works similarly to [running a task](#👷-running-a-task) normally; however, the key difference is that the thread only shuts down when you tell it to. This means that you can run multiple tasks on the same thread rather than spawning up a new one for each call.

Considering the definitions we created [here](#📝-defining-your-tasks), here is how a service would be launched and a task would be called on it.

```TypeScript
// 💡 index.ts
// Importing the Nanolith API we created in worker.ts
import { worker } from './worker.js';

// Spawn up a new thread that has access to all of
// our tasks.
const service = await worker.launchService();

// Command the service thread to run the "add" function.
const result = await service.call({
    name: 'waitThenAdd',
    params: [2, 3],
});

// We can run service.call() as many times as we want, and
// all those tasks will be called on the same thread.

// Similarly to regular task calls, the return value
// is sent back to the main thread and resolve by the call.
console.log(result);

// Shut down the second thread.
await service.close();
```

### `launchService()` options

The configurations for `Nanolith.launchService()` are nearly identical to the [task function options](#task-function-options) with the addition of `exceptionHandler`:

| Name | Type | About |
|-|-|-|
| `exceptionHandler` | **function** | An optional but _highly recommended_ option that allows you to catch uncaught exceptions within the service. |
| `priority` | **boolean** | Whether or not to treat the service's worker as priority over others when being queued into the `pool`. |
| `reffed` | **boolean** | When `true`, the underlying `Worker` instance is [reffed](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#workerref). Defaults to `false`. |
| `messengers` | [**Messenger**](#📨-communicating-between-threads)**[]** | The `Messenger`s that should be accessible to the service. |
| `options` | **object** | An object containing _most_ of the options available on the [`Worker` constructor](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#new-workerfilename-options). |

## 🎬 Coordinating services

In a scalable application utilizing multiple identical [services](#launchservice-options), it is possible to optimize them by treating the main thread as an orchestrator and managing the workloads on each service. Nanolith's `ServiceCluster` automatically does this for you.

<!-- Main thread works as an orchestrator. -->
<!-- Explain what service clusters are and how they can help -->
<!-- Talk about available methods -->

## 🪝 Hooks

<!-- Describe the three hooks available when defining a set of tasks. -->

## 🚨 Managing concurrency

<!-- Discuss pool, what it does, and how to configure it (if needed) -->

## 📨 Communicating between threads

<!-- Discuss the two types of messaging that are supported in Nanolith -->

## 📡 Streaming data between threads

<!-- Discuss using the streaming API on parent, Messenger, or Service -->

## 💾 Sharing memory between threads
